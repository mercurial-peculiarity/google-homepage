In this project I am learning how to deconstruct and reconstruct the google homepage.
The topics I have covered include:
    1. Set up a new repository called google-homepage
    2. Copythe repository to my machine using the 'git clone' command
    3. Create a README.md file
    4. I have learned how to use flex, padding and vertical-align to position text and objects
    5. I have learned how to hide the borders of a text box using border, and to hide the border of the focus box using outline
    6. I have learned how to use box-shadow to create a drop shadow under the search buttons
